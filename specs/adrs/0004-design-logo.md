## Context and Problem Statement

How can we redesign our logo to give our brand character?   

## Decision Drivers 

* Include app colors in logo
* Clever play on name: JRNL with a bullet icon next to it   
  

## Considered Options

* We considered the variety of bullet and pencil options from [here] (https://thenounproject.com)
* We considered different placements of the icon by rotating it and readjusting its position. 

## Decision Outcome

Chosen option: We decided to include a bullet icon rotated to look like a pen writing our app name for a clever play on words. We colored the bullet to match our app colors to add life to our logo. 


### Positive Consequences 

* The improved, unique logo passes the 5-second test and adheres to our goal of creating a minimal, yet stylish UI. 

## Pros and Cons of the Options 

### Bullet Icon

[example | description | pointer to more information | â€¦] <!-- optional -->

* Good, because it relates to the app's function as a bullet journal.
* Good, because it adds character to our logo.
* Bad, because it may not be obvious at first.
