## Context and Problem Statement

How can we design the journal entries to be best for quick and efficient logging by users? 

## Decision Drivers 

* Minimize clutter
* Easy to use
* Efficient logging of entries
  
## Considered Options

* We considered an edit button to the right of each entry, which, upon being clicked, brings the entry into an "edit mode" to adjust entry contents and bullet type/status
* We considered directly clicking on the entry text to edit its contents or migrate it, and clicking on the bullet to edit its type/status. Hotkeys would save, delete, and tab/nest the entry.

## Decision Outcome

Chosen option: We decided to go with the second approach, using hotkeys and shortcuts rather than a dedicated edit button.

### Positive Consequences

* Minimized the amount of visual clutter, no need for multiple unnecessary dropdown menus and edit buttons all over the place.
* Quicker to use, instead of clicking the edit button for every single adjustment, users can instead directly left click the bullet to change its state or right click the text to migrate the entry.
* Experienced users will be able to log and edit entries much more efficiently and smoothly.

### Negative Consequences

* By the nature of shortcuts/hotkeys, more thorough instructions are needed to familiarize the user with handling entries.
* Because all the options are no longer grouped under a single edit button, functionality may start off a bit less intuitive unless thorough instruction is given.

## Pros and Cons of the Options

### Edit Button Approach

* Good, because it is intuitive and groups all edit options under the click of one button.
* Bad, because it is very cluttered and applies to every entry, which may be overwhelming.
* Bad, because it is slower to use despite the core BuJo philosophy of rapid logging.

### Shortcut/Hotkey Approach

* Good, because there is little visual clutter and is in line with the app's minimalistic design.
* Good, because it is fast and efficient to edit entries when used to the controls.
* Bad, because it is less intuitive and may require a good amount of additional work in teaching users how to handle the entries.
