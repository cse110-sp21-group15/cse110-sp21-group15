## Context and Problem Statement

What font, colors, and UI layouts will define our BuJo app?

## Decision Drivers <!-- optional -->

* Minimal Design with Style (not boring to look at)
* Soft color palette that is easy on the eyes
* UI layout that is straightforward and intuitive to use

## Considered Options

* For fonts, we considered Sans Serif fonts from [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com)
* We considered color palettes from the following site: [Link](https://colorhunt.co/palettes/pastel)
* We looked at existing Electron.JS apps for UI design inspiration [Link](https://www.electronjs.org)

## Decision Outcome

Chosen Options: For fonts, we chose Amaranth and Mulish. For color palettes, we chose some lovely pastel colors from [this palette](https://colorhunt.co/palette/159618) and [this palette](https://colorhunt.co/palette/282068). Lastly, our UI design took inspiration from Facebook Messenger's landing page. 

### Positive Consequences <!-- optional -->

* A stylistic, minimal design for our BuJo app will allow users to disconnect from their surroundings and focus on the elegant design of our offline app.

## Pros and Cons of the Options <!-- optional -->

### Fonts

* Good, because the fonts are simple
* Good, because the fonts are not boring
* Bad, because some users may feel limited by our font choices

### Colors

* Good, because the colors are soft on the eyes
* Good, because the colors are warm and complementary
* Bad, because some users may prefer other color schemes

### UI Layout

* Good, because the UI is inspired by existing Electron.JS apps
* Good, because we hone in on a minimal design with eye-catching page ornaments
* Bad, because our app's design is based off existing apps and perhaps may not be very original in some aspects
