## Context and Problem Statement

How should we manage our branching strategy?

## Decision Drivers <!-- optional -->

* Developers should be able to work on features independently
* Last minute issues should be fixed before deploying to production

## Considered Options

* Gitflow
* Only using feature branches

## Decision Outcome

Chosen option: Gitflow, because it allows us to merge effectively to develop and fix issues on release before merging to the production branch.
