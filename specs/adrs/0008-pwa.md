* Status: accepted
* Deciders: Rahul Dadlani
* Date: 2021-05-27

## Context and Problem Statement

What framework/type of app should we build?

## Decision Drivers <!-- optional -->

* The app should be lightweight and operable without Internet
* Would be better for the developers to have familiarity with the type of
app before starting

## Considered Options

* PWAs
* Electron JS

## Decision Outcome

Chosen option: PWA, because we are more familiar with them through the labs and can get up to speed with building one faster
