**2) Primary Means of Communication and Expectations**
- Our primary means of communication are Slack and Zoom.
- We expect members to read Slack messages (particularly mentions) daily and respond within 8-16 hours unless there are extenuating circumstances.
- Members should attend Zoom meetings whenever possible and communicate via Slack if they are unable to attend.

**3) Scheduling Meetings (Schedule at least one meeting as part of constructing your team agreement.)**

- We will schedule meetings by checking for availability through LettuceMeet, and meet synchronously on Zoom or asynchronously on Slack.
- The two team leads Jon and Rahul will take turns sending out reminders.

**4) General Responsibilities for All Team Members**

*This element of the team working agreement is the list of rules/agreements or the contract that all members agrees to live by.*
- Foster a **collaborative** environment and help other team members
- Take **accountability** for the work you create
- **Communicate** clearly and often with each other, whether it be about an issue faced or a request to make
- Take **responsibility** for your own actions and mistakes
- Be **empathetic** to other team members when collaborating and communicating

**5) Conflict Resolution**

*Team members should clearly articulate any conflicts they may have and be understanding toward all parties involved.*

Begin at step 1, if it doesn't work then go to the next step, so on and so forth

1) Try to talk it out amongst the people having the disagreement
2) Write up a document with your POV and what you think the other person's POV is. Exchange the docs and see if that resolves the issue
3) Bring in a third party to settle the matter (preferably someone that's objective in the matter)
4) Discuss with TA Sasya

**6) Expectations of Faculty and GTAâ€™s**

- If a team member fails to meet the guidelines that have been outlined in this agreement, the member and their situation will be reported to the CSE 110 course staff, but the team will still be responsible for submitting a completed assignment. The CSE 110 course staff will be available to meet with teams to resolve issues.
