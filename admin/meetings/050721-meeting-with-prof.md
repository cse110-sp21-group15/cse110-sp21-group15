## When & Where the meeting was held
- When: 4 PM - 5 PM
- Where: Zoom
## The agenda of what is discussed
- lateral thinking
  - look at different types of physical journals
- template engine instead of hardcoded layounts- make things configurable
- an effective journal is personal/sacred/private
- do less but the things you do should be nice
- minimalist but still has a personality
- branding matters a lot
- animation/sound on completing task
- Engineering is attention to detail and quality
- apple vs amazon- apple has the cultural cache but amazon doesn’t, even though amazon does what they do well. Engineering chops + a humanistic approach
  - **soft skills matter**. A good engineer is one that has the engineering chops but ALSO has soft skills and sweats the details (design for humans not for an idealistic mathematical world)
- Allow a toggle like Friction Mode (similar to night mode) that changes the theme
- decoupling- don’t hardcode symbols or language (english vs french) or fonts, etc
  - Instead use templates- pull bullet symbols from a file instead of hard coding
  - let fonts be picked
  - let backgrounds be changed (background color, image, etc)
- From the start, make the app multilingual- language based on location. Easy to configure in code so it should be there from Day 1
- settings manager- edit config files. This allows the app to be customizable
- Look at other habit apps and apply first principles to figure out different templates for habit tracking. There are only a finite amount of ways to track habits
  - Positive vs negative habits
    - Boolean
    - Number
    - Range
  - Different types of charts for different types of habits
    - Bar
    - Line
    - Pie?
- Audio notes! Easy to implement but not many people do it
- Enforce Airplane mode?
- Small pin/pass code to enter journal on desktop- not full blown authentication but something to keep your diary somewhat locked
- Not important but potentially let journals sync (maybe via bluetooth to a phone or a different laptop)
- Pills for categorization? Similar to how @ channel gets highlighted with a background color and font color change
- Things are driven by market elephants- Apple wants you to use swift instead of electron bc swift is less portable and forces you to develop for MacOS. This helps Apple’s business
- Electron has heavy binaries but a user only downloads them once. Another thing people say is that Electron’s slow but really, only bad js will be slow. Good js will be fast
- Explore (desktop js frameworks):
  - Electron.js
  - Progressive Web Apps
    - Service workers
  - Alternatives to Electron.js
- Explore (mobile device js frameworks)
  - Ionic
  - PhoneGap
