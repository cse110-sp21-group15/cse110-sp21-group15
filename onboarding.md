### Codebase

The source directory contains the HTML, CSS, and JS files for our landing page and app. Our bullet journal app is written as a PWA, or a progressive web app. 

### Logistics

The admin directory holds our [meeting records](./admin/meetings) and [branding](./admin/branding). Also in the admin directory is our mid-quarter [status video](./admin/videos) and our [group contract](./admin/misc). Standups and discussion among each sub-team occurred in Slack. 

### CI/CD Pipeline 

Documentation for the overall pipeline, including how to start using the different parts locally, is [here](./pipeline_instructions_for_devs.md) to instruct new developers on how to use each piece. 

Our testing documentation is [here](./testing/testing.md), in the testing directory.

We generate documentation and deploy it automatically through JSDocs. You can see the documentation at this [Github Pages link](https://cse110-sp21-group15.github.io/cse110-sp21-group15/).

If you're interested you can find our group's status reports and pipeline overview videos in the [cipipeline](./admin/cipipeline) directory. 

### Design

The design for our landing page and app are on [Figma](https://www.figma.com/file/fidAnmGA9XGRRAu4ZvUjgL/Bujo-Wireframe?node-id=0%3A1). The final design we chose is on the bottom half of the wireframe, and the upper half is experimental wireframes done by the designers.
