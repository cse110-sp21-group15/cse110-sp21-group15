### What is JRNL?

JRNL, at its core, is a lightweight, private, digital [bullet journaling](www.bulletjournal.com) app for remote students. Itâ€™s designed for students who want to get work done, plan for their future, and reflect on their past. 

### Who is it for?

Remote college students with extra curriculars

### Why use JRNL? The pillars of our design philosophy

Weâ€™ve thoughtfully adapted the physical Bullet Journal and its related principles to a digital medium. These are the pillars of our group's design philosophy:

 - Ease of use
 - Privacy
 - Minimizing distractions
 - Reflection
 - Habit Tracking
 - Decluttering the mind

 Implementing our bujo app as a PWA makes it so that our users can use the app whether they're online or offline, making it so that they can edit entries quickly and conveniently. Thinking in the context of our user personas, we also thought that habit tracking would be a useful feature to implement. 

 ### Planned features 

 These are the planned features we didn't have time to work on. Unfortunately due to time constraints, early mistakes in delegation, and falling down rabbit holes, we couldn't complete the following features. 

  - Habit tracking
  - Reflection
  - Certain web components
  - Making the app downloadable
  - Persistent data storage (Dexie.JS)
  - Entering data
